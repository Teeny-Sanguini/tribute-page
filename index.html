      <p>Zero Suit Samus is one of my favorite characters in Smash Bros. While I am not a fan of the series she is from, it helps to know her origin.</p>

      <p>Metroid: Zero Mission is a game released by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance system in 2004. It is a remake of the first Metroid game, <span>Metroid</span>, which was released for the NES in 1987 (1986 in Japan). As such, Nintendo did not just transplant the game into Metroid: Zero Mission. They gave the graphics a total makeover and added new items, areas, and mini-bosses. They also put in a scenario that was not present in the original game.</p>

      <p>After Samus has defeated Mother Brain, as she did in the original Metroid, she made her way to her ship to escape Zebes. However, the escape was unsuccessful. Just as she was about to leave Zebes, Samus' ship was gunned down by space pirates and she was forced to crash land back on the surface. In the process, Samus had lost her power suit.</p>
